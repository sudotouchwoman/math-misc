# Misc Math-Related Stuff

In this repository I will collect tiny projects I do in my spare time

Currently I am interested in Deep Learning and, more precisely, Reinforcement Learning.
The motivation is quite simple: practice coding, reading and explore something new. For now, the most convenient way to code for me is Colab or plain scripting in Python, but I hope to practice Julia programming, in which I feel a bit cumbersome.

Currently the following sections are present:

+ `optim/`: is given to Simulated Annealing
+ `notebooks/`: contains Jupyter notebooks avaliable in Colab
+ `bandits`: implementation of multiarm bandit problem with $\epsilon$-greedy and UCB agents
